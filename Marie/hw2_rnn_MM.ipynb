        "The number of features in the hidden unit of a GRU is a design choice and can be different from the number of input features (n). It's common to use the same number of hidden units as input features, but this is not always the case. In general, the number of hidden units is a hyperparameter that can be tuned during the model training process. Another approach is to use rules of thumb based on the complexity of the data and task. For example, a simple rule of thumb is to choose the number of hidden units to be between the input and output size. However, this is just a rough guideline and the optimal number of hidden units can vary depending on the specific task and dataset."
